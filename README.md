A quick and dirty attempt at a real-time Chess site using NodeJS and Socket.IO. The backend server with all the actual chess logic is not included! The chess server I'm using was originally created by kodgehopper for use with the Irssi IRC client, and it resides here: http://irc-chess.sourceforge.net/

NOTE: This is still completely in process.
